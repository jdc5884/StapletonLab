# Variance Quantitative Trait Locus (vQTL)

vQTL is the variance Quantitative Trait Locus; it is the investigation 
into which section of DNA correlates the most with the variance of a quantitative trait.
The interest in the variance of a quantitative trait may indicate the evolutionary
fittness of a species. 

This Read the Docs will analyze the vQTL for two main categories: Family
and Random plotting structure for corn height. The main goal for this case study 
is to fix the variation on corn height. As with all vQTL analyses, an adjustment 
for multiple testing by exporting the raw P values from vQTL, adjusting, then 
re-importing the P values and making final plots.

## Family and Random Planting Pattern

This vQTL analysis has a covariate of planting pattern. Family group and
individual (or random) planting pattern are the two different ways considered in plotting corn. 

- Family Group Planting Pattern: Corn with similar genetic information are plotted together.

- Individual Random Planting Pattern: Corn with different genetic information are plotted together.

# vQTL Family and Random Documentation

This repository will serve as a guide for the vQTL analysis of the family and random
corn plotting structures. It is a comparison of neighbor genotype effects on locus detection.

## Purpose

This analysis investigates whether neighboring plant genotype matters for the 
identification of important genomic regions. The planting pattern will be the 
covariate for this vQTL with our phenotype of interest being the height of the 
corn. This analysis is part of a larger project in finding key genomic regions
via vQTL analysis.

#Summary for Feb 9 - Feb 22

Achievements:

Stress Splicing:

	-completed the data cleaning and organization for the height data from the
	 metadata file

	-Created graphs displaying the differences between the inbred heights and
	 hybrid heights. The graphs show a prominet separation between the two and
	 indicate that breedtype is an important covariate in our vQTL analysis.

	-Worked with Drew on visualizing the calibration and experimental data
	 gained an better understanding of how the starting quanitites and the 
	 test_1 data relates to each other. 

HSI:

	-Set up pycharm

	-Discussed the ideas David has on how to approach the problem
	 we must begin by separating and organizing the data for better analysis

Goals for the next two weeks:

	- Work with Jessica on her project and understanding how to run the vQTL
	 analysis. Now that our projects are now dealing with the same issue of 
	 vQTL, it will be easier to discuss and meet about the issues at hand.
	- Begin to work on the data organization for the HSI project. Write robust
	 code for the organization.

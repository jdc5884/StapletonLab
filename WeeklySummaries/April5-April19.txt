Achievements:

	Read the Docs:
		-Banks, Jessica, and I worked on creating a read the docs in the works
		-The ground work for the read the doc is up there are issues with publishing
		 the read the docs page

	Hyperspectral Imaging:

		 the HSI data cube images. We are focusing on how to read the data in and categorize
		 the pixels

	qPCR/vQTL:
		-Drew, Dr. Wang, and I further developed our plan for the adjustment model
		-We are working on incorporating a percentile component into the ordinal logistic model
		 for categorizing the starting quantites and predicting the starting quantities for the 
		 experimental data

Goals for the next two weeks:

	-work on the combination ratios for the qPCR adjustment and the groundwork for the the percentile
	 component of the OLRM
	-troubleshoot issues with the read the docs page
	-readinging the data for the HSI project

#Summary for March 9 - March 22

Achievements:

   Stress Splicing/vQTL Analysis:
	-from Jessica's email to Corty, I have ran his code on the breed/height 
	 data and produced the needed p-values for a subset of the data
	-Consulted with Drew and drew up a flow chart of how to procede with this
	 project given the endgoal of running a vQTL analysis of the qPCR adjusted
	 ratios

   Hyperspectral Imaging:
	-David has helped with progressing my understanding of this project
	-Discussed ways to simulate new data and train a model on the images

Goals for the Next Two Weeks:
	-Run a vQTL analysis on the entire breed/height data through Stampede
	-Add SNP values to the Sampling Plan data
	-Attach the qPCR data to the Sampling Plan and SNP values using the
	 barcode/sampleID

	-Begin some type of code/simulation for the HSI project

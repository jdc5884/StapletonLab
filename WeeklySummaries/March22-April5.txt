#Summary for March 22 - April 5

Achievements:

   Stress Splicing/vQTL Analysis:
	-Discovered the possible extrapolation with our current qPCR model building process
	-Rather than building a linear model based off of the Calibrated data to predict the 
	 Experimental data ratios, we will use a ordinal logistic classification method to find
	 the starting quantities for the Experimental data and take the adjustment accordingly then
	-Drew and I have begun to implement this method into our analyses, we just need to fine tune
	 and/or identify and issues with the model before proceding with the vQTL analysis
	-I have drawn up the basic code for matching the SampleID numbers in the plate data to the 
	 barcodes in the metadata analysis.
	-Edited and further developed my snp matching code to be more robust for future datasets


   Hyperspectral Imaging:
	-Discussed with David how to fix my python and set up appropriate packages
	-Worked with David on what my input on his project would be: code documentaiton

Goals for the Next Two Weeks:
	-Help/learn with Jessica how to use Read the Docs
	-Help Jessica write up the Metadata file for her Family/Random project output
	-Continue to colaborate with David on his project and find out how to code
	 document in a formatted and efficient way
